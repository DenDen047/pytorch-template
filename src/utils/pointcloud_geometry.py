def spatially_uniform_sample(pc: torch.Tensor, n_samples: int) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Perform spatially uniform sampling on the xy-plane of a point cloud.

    This algorithm divides the xy-plane into a grid and samples points evenly from
    occupied grid cells to ensure better spatial distribution of points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pc : torch.Tensor
        Point cloud tensor with shape (N, 3) where N is the number of points.
        The first two columns are the xy-coordinates, and the third column is the z-coordinate (depth).
    n_samples : int
        Number of points to sample.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Sampled point cloud with shape (n_samples, 3).
